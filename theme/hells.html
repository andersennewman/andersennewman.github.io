                <h1>The Hells</h1>
                <p>The Hells are a realm of hatred and evil. Law and chaos affect edges of
                    the plane, creating the Nine Hells and the Abyss. In the middle is Hades.</p>
            </section>
            <section id = "nine">
                <h1>The Nine Hells and Devils</h1>
                <p>The Nine Hells is the realm of Devils. They live in a strict society where
                    all things have a caste and must obey their tyrannical commanders. Mortals
                    often make deals with Devils, as they must obey their pacts and can grant
                    great power. The mortal's soul is often on the line and Devils often place
                    bylaws to cause the mortal to inevitably give up their soul.</p>
            </section>
            <section id = "hades">
                <h1>Hades and Yugoloths</h1>
                <p>Hades is the realm of unfettered ambition with no deference to authority or predilection
                    for pure destruction. The Yugoloths that make Hades home are mercenaries with
                    great power for exorbitant fees. They only keep their contracts until a better
                    one comes along, making them dangerous allies.</p>
            </section>
            <section id = "abyss">
                <h1>The Abyss and Demons</h1>
                <p>The Abyss is an endless series of pits that breed violence and destruction.
                    Demons make their bases here, endlessly killing each other until they gain a greater form. The
                    little hierarchy
                    that exists here is based on power. Demons only follow others who prove more powerful.</p>
            </section>
            <section id = "blood">
                <h1>The Blood War</h1>
                <p>Devils and Demons are engaged in an endless war known as the Blood War. Neither side
                    gains advantage for long, and Yugoloths often exploit this war to gain riches by fighting
                    for both sides for hefty fees. </p>
            </section>
            <section id = "carceri">
                <h1>Carceri</h1>
                <p>Carceri is the fifth level of the Underspire. It shows up as a blasted wasteland inhabited
                    by wandering undead and fiends. It is a gray, depressing place that has an affinity for evil.
                    The one even remotely safe place on this level is Agathys, a dark citadel where laws are upheld
                    with vicious punishment for breaking even the smallest rule.
